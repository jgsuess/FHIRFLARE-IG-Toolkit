# FHIRFLARE IG Toolkit
![FHIRFLARE Logo](static/FHIRFLARE.png)

## Overview

The FHIRFLARE IG Toolkit is a Flask-based web application designed to streamline the management, processing, validation, and deployment of FHIR Implementation Guides (IGs) and test data. It offers a user-friendly interface for importing IG packages, extracting metadata, validating FHIR resources or bundles, pushing IGs to FHIR servers, converting FHIR resources to FHIR Shorthand (FSH), uploading complex test data sets with dependency management, and retrieving/splitting FHIR bundles. The toolkit includes live consoles for real-time feedback, making it an essential tool for FHIR developers and implementers.

The application can run in two modes:

* **Standalone:** Includes a Dockerized Flask frontend, SQLite database, and an embedded HAPI FHIR server for local validation and interaction.
* **Lite:** Includes only the Dockerized Flask frontend and SQLite database, excluding the local HAPI FHIR server. Requires connection to external FHIR servers for certain features.

## Installation Modes (Lite vs. Standalone)

This toolkit offers two primary installation modes to suit different needs:

* **Standalone Version:**
    * Includes the full FHIRFLARE Toolkit application **and** an embedded HAPI FHIR server running locally within the Docker environment.
    * Allows for local FHIR resource validation using HAPI FHIR's capabilities.
    * Enables the "Use Local HAPI" option in the FHIR API Explorer and FHIR UI Operations pages, proxying requests to the internal HAPI server (`http://localhost:8080/fhir`).
    * Requires Git and Maven during the initial build process (via the `.bat` script or manual steps) to prepare the HAPI FHIR server.
    * Ideal for users who want a self-contained environment for development and testing or who don't have readily available external FHIR servers.

* **Lite Version:**
    * Includes the FHIRFLARE Toolkit application **without** the embedded HAPI FHIR server.
    * Requires users to provide URLs for external FHIR servers when using features like the FHIR API Explorer and FHIR UI Operations pages. The "Use Local HAPI" option will be disabled in the UI.
    * Resource validation relies solely on local checks against downloaded StructureDefinitions, which may be less comprehensive than HAPI FHIR's validation (e.g., for terminology bindings or complex invariants).
    * **Does not require Git or Maven** for setup if using the `.bat` script or running the pre-built Docker image.
    * Ideal for users who primarily want to use the IG management, processing, and FSH conversion features, or who will always connect to existing external FHIR servers.

## Features

* **Import IGs:** Download FHIR IG packages and dependencies from a package registry, supporting flexible version formats (e.g., `1.2.3`, `1.1.0-preview`, `current`) and dependency pulling modes (Recursive, Patch Canonical, Tree Shaking).
* **Enhanced Package Search and Import:**
    * Interactive page (`/search-and-import`) to search for FHIR IG packages from configured registries.
    * Displays package details, version history, dependencies, and dependents.
    * Utilizes a local database cache (`CachedPackage`) for faster subsequent searches.
    * Background task to refresh the package cache from registries (`/api/refresh-cache-task`).
    * Direct import from search results.
* **Manage IGs:** View, process, unload, or delete downloaded IGs, with duplicate detection and resolution.
* **Process IGs:** Extract resource types, profiles, must-support elements, examples, and profile relationships (`structuredefinition-compliesWithProfile` and `structuredefinition-imposeProfile`).
* **Validate FHIR Resources/Bundles:** Validate single FHIR resources or bundles against selected IGs, with detailed error and warning reports (alpha feature). *Note: Lite version uses local SD checks only.*
* **Push IGs:** Upload IG resources (and optionally dependencies) to a target FHIR server. Features include:
    * Real-time console output.
    * Authentication support (Bearer Token).
    * Filtering by resource type or specific files to skip.
    * Semantic comparison to skip uploading identical resources (override with **Force Upload** option).
    * Correct handling of canonical resources (searching by URL/version before deciding POST/PUT).
    * Dry run mode for simulation.
    * Verbose logging option.
* **Upload Test Data:** Upload complex sets of test data (individual JSON/XML files or ZIP archives) to a target FHIR server. Features include:
    * Robust parsing of JSON and XML (using `fhir.resources` library when available).
    * Automatic dependency analysis based on resource references within the uploaded set.
    * Topological sorting to ensure resources are uploaded in the correct order.
    * Cycle detection in dependencies.
    * Choice of individual resource uploads or a single transaction bundle.
    * **Optional Pre-Upload Validation:** Validate resources against a selected profile package before uploading.
    * **Optional Conditional Uploads (Individual Mode):** Check resource existence (GET) and use conditional `If-Match` headers for updates (PUT) or create resources (PUT/POST). Falls back to simple PUT if unchecked.
    * Configurable error handling (stop on first error or continue).
    * Authentication support (Bearer Token).
    * Streaming progress log via the UI.
    * Handles large numbers of files using a custom form parser.
* **Profile Relationships:** Display and validate `compliesWithProfile` and `imposeProfile` extensions in the UI (configurable).
* **FSH Converter:** Convert FHIR JSON/XML resources to FHIR Shorthand (FSH) using GoFSH, with advanced options (Package context, Output styles, Log levels, FHIR versions, Fishing Trip, Dependencies, Indentation, Meta Profile handling, Alias File, No Alias). Includes a waiting spinner.
* **Retrieve and Split Bundles:**
    * Retrieve specified resource types as bundles from a FHIR server.
    * Optionally fetch referenced resources, either individually or as full bundles for each referenced type.
    * Split uploaded ZIP files containing bundles into individual resource JSON files.
    * Download retrieved/split resources as a ZIP archive.
    * Streaming progress log via the UI for retrieval operations.
* **FHIR Interaction UIs:** Explore FHIR server capabilities and interact with resources using the "FHIR API Explorer" (simple GET/POST/PUT/DELETE) and "FHIR UI Operations" (Swagger-like interface based on CapabilityStatement). *Note: Lite version requires custom server URLs.*
* **HAPI FHIR Configuration (Standalone Mode):**
    * A dedicated page (`/config-hapi`) to view and edit the `application.yaml` configuration for the embedded HAPI FHIR server.
    * Allows modification of HAPI FHIR properties directly from the UI.
    * Option to restart the HAPI FHIR server (Tomcat) to apply changes.
* **API Support:** RESTful API endpoints for importing, pushing, retrieving metadata, validating, uploading test data, and retrieving/splitting bundles.
* **Live Console:** Real-time logs for push, validation, upload test data, FSH conversion, and bundle retrieval operations.
* **Configurable Behavior:** Control validation modes, display options via `app.config`.
* **Theming:** Supports light and dark modes.

## Setup Instructions

### Running Pre-built Images (General Users)

This is the easiest way to get started without needing Git or Maven. Choose the version you need:

**Lite Version (No local HAPI FHIR):**

```bash
# Pull the latest Lite image
docker pull ghcr.io/sudo-jhare/fhirflare-ig-toolkit-lite:latest

# Run the Lite version (maps port 5000 for the UI)
# You'll need to create local directories for persistent data first:
# mkdir instance logs static static/uploads instance/hapi-h2-data
docker run -d \
  -p 5000:5000 \
  -v ./instance:/app/instance \
  -v ./static/uploads:/app/static/uploads \
  -v ./instance/hapi-h2-data:/app/h2-data \
  -v ./logs:/app/logs \
  --name fhirflare-lite \
  ghcr.io/sudo-jhare/fhirflare-ig-toolkit-lite:latest
Standalone Version (Includes local HAPI FHIR):

Bash

Development Notes
Background
The toolkit addresses the need for a comprehensive FHIR IG management tool, with recent enhancements for resource validation, FSH conversion with advanced GoFSH features, flexible versioning, improved IG pushing, dependency-aware test data uploading, and bundle retrieval/splitting, making it a versatile platform for FHIR developers.

Technical Decisions
Flask: Lightweight and flexible for web development.
SQLite: Simple for development; consider PostgreSQL for production.
Bootstrap 5.3.3: Responsive UI with custom styling.
Lottie-Web: Renders themed animations for FSH conversion waiting spinner.
GoFSH/SUSHI: Integrated via Node.js for advanced FSH conversion and round-trip validation.
Docker: Ensures consistent deployment with Flask and HAPI FHIR.
Flexible Versioning: Supports non-standard IG versions (e.g., -preview, -ballot).
Live Console/Streaming: Real-time feedback for complex operations (Push, Upload Test Data, FSH, Retrieve Bundles).
Validation: Alpha feature with ongoing FHIRPath improvements.
Dependency Management: Uses topological sort for Upload Test Data feature.
Form Parsing: Uses custom Werkzeug parser for Upload Test Data to handle large numbers of files.
Recent Updates
* Enhanced package search page with caching, detailed views (dependencies, dependents, version history), and background cache refresh.
Upload Test Data Enhancements (April 2025):
Added optional Pre-Upload Validation against selected IG profiles.
Added optional Conditional Uploads (GET + POST/PUT w/ If-Match) for individual mode.
Implemented robust XML parsing using fhir.resources library (when available).
Fixed 413 Request Entity Too Large errors for large file counts using a custom Werkzeug FormDataParser.
Path: templates/upload_test_data.html, app.py, services.py, forms.py.
Push IG Enhancements (April 2025):
Added semantic comparison to skip uploading identical resources.
Added "Force Upload" option to bypass comparison.
Improved handling of canonical resources (search before PUT/POST).
Added filtering by specific files to skip during push.
More detailed summary report in stream response.
Path: templates/cp_push_igs.html, app.py, services.py.
Waiting Spinner for FSH Converter (April 2025):
Added a themed (light/dark) Lottie animation spinner during FSH execution.
Path: templates/fsh_converter.html, static/animations/, static/js/lottie-web.min.js.
Advanced FSH Converter (April 2025):
Added support for GoFSH advanced options: --fshing-trip, --dependency, --indent, --meta-profile, --alias-file, --no-alias.
Displays Fishing Trip comparison reports.
Path: templates/fsh_converter.html, app.py, services.py, forms.py.
(New) Retrieve and Split Data (May 2025):
Added UI and API for retrieving bundles from a FHIR server by resource type.
Added options to fetch referenced resources (individually or as full type bundles).
Added functionality to split uploaded ZIP files of bundles into individual resources.
Streaming log for retrieval and ZIP download for results.
Paths: templates/retrieve_split_data.html, app.py, services.py, forms.py.
Known Issues and Workarounds
Favicon 404: Clear browser cache or verify /app/static/favicon.ico.
CSRF Errors: Set FLASK_SECRET_KEY and ensure {{ form.hidden_tag() }} in forms.
Import Fails: Check package name/version and connectivity.
Validation Accuracy: Alpha feature; report issues to GitHub (remove PHI).
Package Parsing: Non-standard .tgz filenames may parse incorrectly. Fallback uses name-only parsing.
Permissions: Ensure instance/ and static/uploads/ are writable.
GoFSH/SUSHI Errors: Check ./logs/flask_err.log for ERROR:services:GoFSH failed. Ensure valid FHIR inputs and SUSHI installation.
Upload Test Data XML Parsing: Relies on fhir.resources library for full validation; basic parsing used as fallback. Complex XML structures might not be fully analyzed for dependencies with basic parsing. Prefer JSON for reliable dependency analysis.
413 Request Entity Too Large: Primarily handled by CustomFormDataParser for /api/upload-test-data. Check the parser's max_form_parts limit if still occurring. MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH in app.py controls overall size. Reverse proxy limits (client_max_body_size in Nginx) might also apply.

Upload Test Data: Improve XML parsing further (direct XML->fhir.resource object if possible), add visual progress bar, add upload order preview, implement transaction bundle size splitting, add 'Clear Target Server' option (with confirmation).
Validation: Enhance FHIRPath for complex constraints; add API endpoint.
Sorting: Sort IG versions in /view-igs (e.g., ascending).
Duplicate Resolution: Options to keep latest version or merge resources.
Production Database: Support PostgreSQL.
Error Reporting: Detailed validation error paths in the UI.
FSH Enhancements: Add API endpoint for FSH conversion; support inline instance construction.
FHIR Operations: Add complex parameter support (e.g., /$diff with left/right).
Retrieve/Split Data: Add option to filter resources during retrieval (e.g., by date, specific IDs).
Completed Items
Testing suite with basic coverage.
API endpoints for POST /api/import-ig and POST /api/push-ig.
Flexible versioning (-preview, -ballot).
CSRF fixes for forms.
Resource validation UI (alpha).
FSH Converter with advanced GoFSH features and waiting spinner.
Push IG enhancements (force upload, semantic comparison, canonical handling, skip files).
Upload Test Data feature with dependency sorting, multiple upload modes, pre-upload validation, conditional uploads, robust XML parsing, and fix for large file counts.
Retrieve and Split Data functionality with reference fetching and ZIP download.
Far-Distant Improvements
Cache Service: Use Redis for IG metadata caching.
Database Optimization: Composite index on ProcessedIg.package_name and ProcessedIg.version.

Troubleshooting
Favicon 404: Clear browser cache or verify /app/static/favicon.ico: docker exec -it <container_name> curl http://localhost:5000/static/favicon.ico
CSRF Errors: Set FLASK_SECRET_KEY and ensure {{ form.hidden_tag() }} in forms.
Import Fails: Check package name/version and connectivity.
Validation Accuracy: Alpha feature; report issues to GitHub (remove PHI).
Package Parsing: Non-standard .tgz filenames may parse incorrectly. Fallback uses name-only parsing.
Permissions: Ensure instance/ and static/uploads/ are writable: chmod -R 777 instance static/uploads logs
GoFSH/SUSHI Errors: Check ./logs/flask_err.log for ERROR:services:GoFSH failed. Ensure valid FHIR inputs and SUSHI installation: docker exec -it <container_name> sushi --version
413 Request Entity Too Large: Increase MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH and MAX_FORM_PARTS in app.py. If using a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx), increase its client_max_body_size setting as well. Ensure the application/container is fully restarted/rebuilt.
